CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications due to their effectiveness in processing visual data.\n",

Instead of just R, G, and B channels, now we have more channels but a lesser width and height. This operation is called **Convolution**. If the patch size is the same as that of the image it will be a regular neural network. Because of this small patch, we have fewer weights.\n",

It slides over the input image data and computes the dot product between the kernel weight and the corresponding input image patch. The output of this layer is referred to as feature maps.
